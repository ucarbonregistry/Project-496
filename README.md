Wind Energy Project in Gujarat 

Vish Wind Infrastructure LLP (“VWIL") has developed 50.4 MW wind power project at Kutch and Lalpur sites of Kutch and Jamnagar districts respectively, in the state of Gujarat in India. The project consists of 63 machines of Enercon make E-53 type Wind Energy Converters (WECs) each of capacity 800 KW.The purpose of the project activity is to generate emission free and environment friendly electricity from the wind energy potential available in the region. The project is expected to generate and supply 106,696.80 MWh of electricity annually to the state electricity grid, which is a part of the NEWNE (Northern, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern) grid in India.

The first machine under the project activity was commissioned on 2nd October 2011 and last
machine under the project activity was commissioned on 31st March 2012. The project activity involves 63 numbers wind energy converters (WECs) of Enercon make (800
KW, E53) with internal electrical lines connecting the project activity with local evacuation facility.
The WECs generate 3-phase power at 400V, which is stepped up to 33 KV. The project activity can
operate in the frequency range of 48.5–51.5 Hz and in the voltage range of 400 V ± 12.5%.
